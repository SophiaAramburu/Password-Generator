# Password Generator

## First Javascript Assignment

**Goal:**

My goal for this challenge was to make a functional password generator using the JavaScript skills I attained this week. During this project, I was also able to practice my debugging skills when some aspects of the script wasn't there. I did struggle with one missing closing tag on my HTML where the JS links in the HTML. I looked for the error for 2 hours because I was looking on the JS file and not the HTML. So, that taught me to make sure to cross all my x's and dot all my i's when debugging. I also was able to use my new knowledge of Javascript to solve the problems that were on the page given to me. This project got me more comforatable with early Javascript fundamentals and will help me be more efficient in my next project.

**Adding Functionality to a Password Generator**

- I was given starter code that had a css and an html layout that was started for me, so that I could add Javascript elements that would make the page work. I knew that I would need to add all of the characters into arrays because thats how i've been taught to start in class. I had to put them into arrays so that they could be properly executed into the password when generated. I started by figuring out what all of the starter code did, so that I could know where I needed to start. Looking through what I was given, I noticed that there was a function being called, but not the function was not defined. In that case, I knew I had to make it. 

- I added the elements that were missing and then I used window.promt to create a starting point for the user. I added all of the conditions that was in the Acceptance Criteria for the user to select and then paired them up to the arrays. I made sure there was a way the input to be confirmed to double check that everything would work nicely when the user made a choice. Finally, I added descriptive comments inside the JavaScript file to help make the file more accessible and readable to the viewer.
